_Automated customization of large-scale spiking network models to neuronal population activity_    Shenghao Wu, Chengcheng Huang, Adam Snyder, Matthew Smith*, Brent Doiron*, and Byron Yu*


The file structure is as follows:

-data: contains sample target spike train and the log file for the optimization
-utils: contains helper functions
    -fa_Yu: functions for performing Factor Analysis, written by Byron Yu (https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~byronyu/software.shtml)
-example.m: contains a short demo where a classical balanced spiking network is fitted to a target spike train generated by the same type of network with a ground truth parameter set. Expect 10-15 mins to run the demo.
-SNOPS.m: main fitting function. The following eight input variables need to be specified:
    target_train_name:  spike trains to fit the network model to.
    simulator: function handle to network model. See /utils/SBN.m for details of the input/output of this function.
    parameter_range:  [n_parameters, 2], range of parameters. First and second columns are lower and upper bounds.
    max_iter: int, stopping criterion (in iterations).
    T: int, network model simulation length (in ms). We recommend using the same length as the target spike train for consistency.
    Ne: int, number of E neurons in the read-out layer. This is the neurons on which activity statistics are computed
    save_name: string, name of the log file for optimization. This is located in the data folder and can be used to check the details of the optimization for each iteration.
    is_plot: int(0/1), if illustrative plot is needed. If turned off, fitting information will be printed in the stout.
